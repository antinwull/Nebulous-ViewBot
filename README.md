Either the people who manage the account servers fixed this, or the Nebulous servers are just garbage. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

You can use the following(really basic) batch script to get the most out of a view bot:
```
@echo off

set /a views=0
set /a total_views=0

rem set your ticket here vv. before setting it though, make sure it's url-encoded.
rem see the text below this script for a website you can use to url-encode your ticket.
set /a ticket=

rem set the account id here that will recieve the views
set /a accID=0

:loop
if %views% equ 25 (
  echo Total views: %total_views%
  timeout /t 30 /nobreak
  set /a views=0
)

curl -d "Game=Nebulous&Version=1065&Ticket=%ticket%&accountID=%accID%" https://www.simplicialsoftware.com/api/account/GetPlayerProfile

set /a views+=1
set /a total_views+=1

goto :loop
```
This will work provided you don't stop, then restart the script within the same minute. Also, you'd be averaging 25 views per minute, lol.
The reason why I capped the view count to 25 per minute is because on the 30th profile request without pausing, the server will begin to send back a `400 Bad Request` error.
